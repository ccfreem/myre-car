# myre-car

A repository for consideration to HyreCar.

## Requirements

High Level - Create your own single page web application that allows users to perform queries and commands to cars that they own using React as your frontend and Graphql/Node.js as your backend.

Details:

1. Use apollo server for backend
2. Use react for front end
3. No need for a persistence layer
4. Implement error handling
5. Be creative
6. Form validation
7. Likes: material-ui, hooks, apollo client

## Project setup

#### Front end

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn all`

This project leverages the package [https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently](concurrently) which has been configured to simultaneously run the apollo server and the frontend in development mode.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Acknowledgements

1. This is not “Done” - Definition of Done for this was POC
2. Step 0 - I didn’t validate requirements
   1. Usually this needs to be buttoned down prior to touching code
   2. Conversations save money
3. Things I would work on
   1. Responsive design
   2. More CSS reuse
   3. Break out components more
   4. Expand on validation
   5. Consistency
      1. I use a lot of different methods in here, to start a conversation, not to declare what is “right” or “wrong”
   6. State management - getting REAALLLY close
   7. More branches - I don’t ever commit directly to dev
      1. Break out by features - prs
   8. CICD - manual deployments are scary

# Questions

1. What’s a typical - what are the big projects coming up?
2. What’s the lifecycle - higher ups -> management -> designers? -> pms? -> testers -> support staff?
3. How are developers evaluated
4. How long has your team been together
5. Am I here as a replacement? Or is this to accommodate growth
6. Given what you know about me and my skillset, where do see gaps in what I would be doing.
7. What are potential barriers that I may face?
8. Confirm my location
